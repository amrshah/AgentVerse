# AgentVerse

**AgentVerse** is a powerful, open-source platform for creating, managing, and orchestrating teams of autonomous AI agents. Built with a modern tech stack, it provides a flexible and intuitive interface for designing complex workflows where specialized agents collaborate to achieve a common goal.

Whether you're looking to automate daily tasks, generate creative content, or build sophisticated multi-agent systems, AgentVerse provides the tools to bring your vision to life.

## Core Concepts

- **Agents**: Specialized AI entities with a defined name, role, and objectives. You can create custom agents or use pre-built ones from our library.
- **Orchestration**: A flexible, drag-and-drop environment where you can build custom teams of agents and run them against a specific task. This is the "advanced mode" for power users.
- **Workflows**: Guided, structured processes that leverage a core team of agents to automate common tasks, like a daily planning session.
