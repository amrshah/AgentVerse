# AgentVerse

Welcome to AgentVerse, a multi-agent orchestration platform built with Next.js and Genkit.

This project allows you to create, manage, and run teams of AI agents to accomplish complex tasks.

## Current Status

**Version 0.1.0: Initial Prototype Complete**

We have completed the initial prototype which includes the core functionality for agent creation, team management, and AI-driven orchestration.

Key features implemented:
- Draggable agent management
- Dynamic team creation
- AI-assisted agent profiling and tool schema generation
- A rich library of orchestration presets for various industries
- An agent memory inspector
- A "Run in Steps" debug mode with streaming output
- The ability to download execution logs
- A "Strict Mode" for deterministic outputs
- Customizable AI model settings

## Next Steps

We are now beginning the **Platform Phase**, which will transform AgentVerse into a collaborative, multi-user application.

For a detailed vision and the full feature roadmap, please see [Feature Roadmap](docs/planning/feature-roadmap.md).


## Getting Started

To explore the application code, a good starting point is `src/app/page.tsx`, which renders the main dashboard.
