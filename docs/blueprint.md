# **App Name**: AgentVerse

## Core Features:

- Agent Creation: Allow users to create individual agents with customizable roles, objectives, and constraints, and integrate third party tools to enable greater access to the real world. The application provides a list of third party tools and their required fields/authorizations, but also allows users to describe other available tools for an LLM tool.
- Team Formation: Enable users to form teams by assigning specific agents to collaborative tasks.
- Orchestration Engine: This engine is able to run and monitor agents and report the result when agents have finished the execution. Includes mechanisms for task delegation, result aggregation, and conflict resolution.
- User Interface for Team Visualization: Provide a drag-and-drop interface for users to visualize team structures and agent interactions within the system.
